## Usage

## TODO

* Support changing label of devices (requires `admin` role in OAuth against littlebits.cc).
* Support registering devices (requires `admin` scope).
* Support custom recipe for LittleBits device (move recipe to `config.yml`)
* Support more detailed debugging (i.e. raw-cloud-api feedback).
* Support more languages (i18n) - esp. Danish
* More minified jar-file (we include too much of apache httpcomponents atm).
